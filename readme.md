# mp3_gui
didn't like running youtube_dl in the command prompt every time. wanted to practice making gui applications so made this.
i am aware of a youtube_dl gui which is much better but wanted to try and make something myself.

# requirements
* wxpython
* youtube_dl
view requirements.txt for specific details

# packaging using pyinstaller
i've successfully created an .exe which runs fine. used the arguments --name *whatever* --onefile --noconsole
