# mp3_gui
wanted a very simple program to very quickly download youtube videos and convert them to mp3s. was tired of running the youtube_dl command in command prompt every time. to try and learn a little bit about wxpython i decided to create this. seems to work ok for my needs but the code is very bad and could probably be greatly improved.

# requirements
* wxpython
* youtube_dl
